# NeuroCore — repository working rules

> **New-session entry point:** read [`NEUROCORE_START_HERE.md`](NEUROCORE_START_HERE.md) first, then verify the current branch head, latest Actions status, and the open-work register in [`docs/WORKPASS76_REPO_SURFACE_AUDIT_2026-10-19.md`](docs/WORKPASS76_REPO_SURFACE_AUDIT_2026-10-19.md). The mission is persistent across chats; do not ask the user to restate it.

## Project objective

Build **NeuroCore** as one cohesive, memory-rich, learning and adaptive system. The repository retains the historical `Neuro-Kurisu` name in paths and older documents; that name is implementation lineage, not a reason to fork the architecture.

Work code-first. Prefer observable, testable behavior over architectural labels. Do not add placeholder modules, duplicate sources of truth, fake metrics, unconnected components, empty stubs, or claims of consciousness/autonomy unsupported by external evidence. Keep research candidates separate until they pass integration and regression gates.

## Canonical navigation

- `README.md`: current repository status and release gates.
- `docs/WORKPASS72_HANDOVER_2026-10-19.md`: current implementation finding, validation scope and next queue.
- `docs/REPOSITORY_CLEANUP_AUDIT_WORKPASS72.md` plus its JSON manifest: exact content-duplicate audit; candidates are not deletion instructions.
- `runtime/neuro-kurisu/`: canonical organism/runtime implementation.
- `runtime/neuro-kurisu/src/organism/developmental/MemoryOS2.ts`: canonical memory store and retrieval owner.
- `runtime/neuro-kurisu/src/organism/memory/MemoryRetrievalBenchmark.ts`: offline BM25-vs-candidate evaluation; it must not mutate or promote live state.
- `runtime/neuro-kurisu/src/organism/memory/MemoryRetrievalExperiment.ts`: deterministic multi-seed bootstrap sensitivity check; seeds do not train the retriever.
- `runtime/neuro-kurisu/tests/`: runtime regression tests.
- `app/`: client/UI shell; do not implement a second organism or canonical memory owner here.
- `research/`: isolated experiments; `legacy/`: preserved historical source and provenance.
- `docs/history/`: archived reports and source records. Old `WORKPASS*`, `ROADMAP*`, and numbered pass files are historical unless a current status page links to them.

## Required workflow for a meaningful change

1. Read the current README, current handover, owning implementation, and the narrowest relevant tests before editing.
2. State the failure mode in reproducible terms. Make the smallest effective behavioral fix; avoid refactors that obscure attribution.
3. Add a regression that fails for the original defect and passes for the intended behavior. Prefer behavioral assertions over checking source text.
4. Run the owning tests and runtime typecheck. Use GitHub Actions for cross-cutting changes; cite the exact run and conclusion.
5. Inspect the resulting diff and update the current handover/changelog. Report what ran, what passed, what remains unverified, and whether observed behavior changed.
6. Do not claim recall uplift, user-level learning, device performance, production readiness, or external grounding from a unit test alone.

## Architecture and memory constraints

- Keep one canonical owner per capability. Use existing adapters rather than duplicating memory stores, action gateways, or truth/evidence records.
- Retrieval ranking currently uses BM25/lexical coverage, fuzzy matching, concept aliases, entity signals, graph/temporal signals and intent-fit. The legacy 48-dimensional hash projection is **not** a real semantic embedding and must not be reported as semantic recall.
- Retrieval should not mutate residency policy merely to calculate a signal that is not used in ranking. Explicit access, consolidation, and residency planning own vector materialization.
- A benchmark candidate and baseline must receive the same validated corpus. Truncated, malformed, duplicate or leaked data must block promotion.
- Keep sensitive data out of embedding requests; local/offline operation and sanitized remote-provider boundaries need regression tests.

## Cleanup / evidence policy

- Inventory imports, package scripts, workflows, manifests, tests, licenses, provenance and restore paths before deleting or moving files.
- Similar filenames are not proof of duplication. Preserve licenses, research experiments, source snapshots, binary evidence and old handovers until references and reproducibility are checked.
- Prefer a reversible archive move with link updates and a manifest over deletion. Do not turn documentation volume, test count or a passing synthetic fixture into a quality score.
- Use evidence labels precisely: `PROVEN` (externally validated), `IMPLEMENTED` (code exists), `FUNCTIONAL INDICATOR` (proxy), `OBSERVED` (measured in a stated run), `HYPOTHESIS`, `UNKNOWN`, `UNRESOLVED`, or `FAILED`.


## Verification provenance rule

Never treat a caller-provided `independentVerified` boolean, tool ACK, or copied JSON object as independent evidence. Replay/policy learning must require the exact normalized object issued by `OutcomeVerificationService` for a matching external postcondition. Keep a regression for spoofed booleans, copied tokens, late proof, and idempotent duplicate delivery in the active CI workflow.
